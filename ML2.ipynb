        "Key Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "For the results of Simple Linear Regression to be reliable and valid, several key assumptions about the data and the relationship between the variables must be met:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent variable (\n",
        ") and the dependent variable (\n",
        ") must be linear. This means that the data points should roughly follow a straight line when plotted.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. This means that the error for one observation should not be related to the error for any other observation. This assumption is often violated in time series data or when there are dependencies between observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors): The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variable. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same for all predicted values. If the variance of the errors increases or decreases as the independent variable changes, it is called heteroscedasticity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normality of Errors: The errors (residuals) should be normally distributed. This means that if you were to plot a histogram of the residuals, it should resemble a bell curve. While this assumption is less critical for large sample sizes due to the Central Limit Theorem, it is important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. No Multicollinearity (for multiple regression, but relevant to consider in SLR with dummy variables): While strictly an assumption for multiple linear regression, it's worth noting that in SLR, the independent variable should not be perfectly correlated with any other variable in the model (though in SLR, there's only one independent variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "Violations of these assumptions can lead to biased estimates, incorrect standard errors, and invalid statistical inferences. It's important to check these assumptions when building and evaluating an SLR model."
